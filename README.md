# python_code


1. I did not have a Postgres database available so I utilized
sqllite.

2. The only difference for this exercise would have been the
connection string and the requirement of the 
python module "psycopg2".

3. I did not understand 3E.
Not sure which (actual) totals you were referring to, there
is only one actual value in each row.
So, I did not submit a script for that requirement

4. I embedded python script   
sw_2_A_excel_chart.py
with the shell script
sw_2_A_python.sh
and tested both

Not sure what the designation 2.79 means

5. Was not able to complete the d3 plotting.  Just not familiar with the
java script library functionality. Something that I would like to learn
Fluent in Django for creating graphs, not as sexy as d3 but very functional.

6. Added a requirements file for the python modules that needed to be implemented for this task

7. Labeled the scripts (and input and output) numerically according to the task.
